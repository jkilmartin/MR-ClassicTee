# MR-ClassicTee

This a simple product details section of a clothing retail site.

*I gave myself a 3 hour mini sprint to complete this project, unfortunately I haven't done everything I was hoping for, but considering my short time frame, I'm very proud of what i've done.*

#### Reflection:

If I had more time I would first off
* style the 'on click' border class properly. 
* fix the mini carts spacing etc.
* Mobile / Web View looks pretty good. However there is a 4th break point I'd need to implement to make it look better when going between 1000px and 800px or so.
